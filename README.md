# Warning! This mod does not update automatically through Github

You will have to manually update each patch to the mod. Full update support is only through Steam.

# Getting Started

## No Github Experience
* Click on the green "<> Code" button and download the ZIP.
* Extract the folder to get the Tirfola folder.

## Installation
* Locate your Paradox Interactive folder in your documents folder. This is most likely in your C: drive.
* Open the folder and go down the path Europa Universalis IV/mod/.
* Place the extracted folder here.
* The same folder will be in the extracted folder. Make sure to take it out so there isn't a duplicate folder.
* When you open the folder it should immediately show you all the folders such as common and map.
* Alongside the folders there is a file called "Tirfola_Empire_of_a_New_Dawn.mod". Move that file one back to be next to the folder Tirfola_Empire_of_a_New_Dawn.
* Lastely go into that file and make sure it is using the correct path. You might need to change the Drive if you moved the documents folder to another drive.
